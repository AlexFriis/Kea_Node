            Here's a list of the coding conventions i try sticking to:

                Keeping a good code standard ensures quality and readability which directly translates to better maintainability.
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Proper naming and declaration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Descriptive naming and declaration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep It Simple Stupid - Avoid confusion.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Proper spacing for operators 1+1 is harder to read than 1 + 1.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Statement rules - Always end a statement with a semicolon.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Keep closing brackets on the same line to ensure readability.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <br>
                Side note - Every developer has their own unique coding-style and biases towards specific coding conventions.
                <br>
                What one party may find important may be completely irrelevant to another party.
                <br>
                Therefore a common understanding of codepractices is usually discussed among groups of programmers to ensure everyone is on the same page.
