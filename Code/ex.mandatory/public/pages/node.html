                    Node.js is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, which is designed to build scalable network applications.
                    <br> 
                    This can be done with various frameworks and in this project Express has been used.

                    <br>
                    Assuming we start out with an empty project we first create a file called app.js
                    <br>
                    In this file we specify configurations for the application.
                    <br>
                    This could be to initialize express, define serverport or create our endpoints.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    To run a node application open a terminal of choice and enter the following: node applicationName.js

                    Nodemon is a tool only used in production.
                    <br>
                    Many IDE's allow users the functionality of reloading your application as changes are made.
                    <br>
                    This functionality also exists for node, in the form of nodemon.
                    <br>
                    Nodemon wraps the node app, watches the filesystem and automatically restarts the process.
                    <br>
                    It's a critical tool used in development to save time by not having to input "node app.js" to run your application manually every time changes are made.

        Package.json

                    Diving further into node and its uses we'll take a look at the package.json file.
                    <br>
                    package.json is the center of a node project. It records important metadata about a project which is required before publishing to npm.
                    <br>
                    It also defines functional attributes of a project that npm uses to install dependencies, run scripts and identify the entrypoint to the package.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Dependencies are best managed using npm commands such as <strong>npm install</strong>, <strong>npm uninstall</strong> and <strong>npm update</strong> to keep the node_modules in sync.
                    <br>
                    By manually adding dependencies without using terminal commands we still have to run npm install before the dependency is actually added to the project.
