                    Server-side rendering is the ability of an application to display webpages on the server instead of rendering it in the browser.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Advantages:</strong>
                    <br>
                    SSR enables faster loading and betters the user experience.
                    <br>
                    Plays a role in SEO as search engines favor pages with faster loading times.
                    <br>
                    Assists with loading for users with slower internet connections.
                    <br>
                    Assist with loading for users with outdated devices.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Disadvantages:</strong>
                    <br>
                    Slower page transitions.
                    <br>
                    Bigger surface area - more vulnerable.
                    <br>
                    Responsetime dependant on trafict - The more trafic the slower the response.
                    <br>
                    Can be timeconsuming to render bigger applications.

        How SSR was used to build this project.

                   This project was developed based on the requirements of the mandatory assignment which include using SSR and using Express to serve the pages.
                   <br>
                   Express was imported to this project by including it as a dependency in the package.json file.
                   <br>
                   Then we install our depencies with the following command: npm install.
