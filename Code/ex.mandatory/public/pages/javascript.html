            Javascript Variables

                        Variables defined with <strong>let</strong> cannot be redeclared.
                        <br>
                        Variables defined with <strong>let</strong> must be declared before use.
                        <br>
                        Variables defined with <strong>let</strong> have block scope.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Variables defined with <strong>const</strong> cannot be redeclared.
                        <br>
                        Variables defined with <strong>const</strong> cannot be reassigned.
                        <br>
                        Variables defined with <strong>const</strong> have block scope.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In practice we strive to use <strong>const</strong> and <strong>let</strong> instead of <strong>var</strong> as they are limited to the scope whereas var declares a variable globally regardless of scope.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Hoisting is JavaScript's default behaviour of moving all declarations to the top of the current script or function.
                        <br>
                        This allows us to declare variables after they've been used.
                        <br>
                        Which can also be turned around to - A variable can be used before it has been declared.

                        Callback functions can be used to pass an argument to another function.
                        <br>
                        Allows a function to call another function.
                        <br>
                        Callback functions can also run subsequently as other functions finish.
                        <br>
                        Callback functions has various functionality but really shines when used asynchronous where one function has to wait for another.
