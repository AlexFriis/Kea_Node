                    Important to note that REST is a set of architectural constraints and not a protocol or a standard.
                    <br>
                    These constraints secure a better overview, better maintainabilily and longevity.
                    <br>
                    However there are still conventions and principles we have to follow.

                In order for an API to be considered restful it has to conform to these criteria:
                <br>
                A client-server architecture made up of clients and servers, with requests managed through HTTP.
                <br>
                A uniform interface been components so that information is transferred in a standard form.
                <br>
                A client-server design pattern that enforces the seperation of concerns. To help client and server evolve independently.
                <br>
                Stateless - Which mandates that each request from the client to the server must contain all necessary information to complete requests.
                <br>
                Cacheable - requires that a response should be implicitly or explicitly label itself as either cacheable or non-cacheable.
                <br>
                A layered system that allows an architecture to be composed of hierachical layers by constraining component behaviour.
                <br>
                Code on demand (Optional) - Which allows client functionality to extend by downloading or executing code in the form of applets or scripts.

        Naming Conventions

                    In REST all primary data representation is called a resource. Having a consistent naming strategy is one of the best design decisions in the long term.
                    <br>
                    the RESTful URI should refer to a resource that is a thing rather than an action - therefore we use <strong>nouns</strong>.
                    <br>
                    The document resource is a singular concept therefore we apply the same principle and denote document resources as <strong>singular</strong>.
                    <br>
                    We use the <strong>plural</strong> name when denoting the collection resource archetype.
                    <br>
                    A store is a client-managed resource collection therefore we use <strong>plural</strong> to denote the store resource archetype.
                    <br>
                    As controller resources are actions we use <strong>verbs</strong> when naming them - ../playlist/play.
                    <br>
                    Consistency is key - keeping maintainability and readability in focus.
                    <br>

              Few examples:
              <br>

              REQUEST - Endpoint - action
              <br>
              GET - /movies - Retrieves all Movies
              <br>
              GET - /movies/{id} - Retrieves a single resources by respective ID
              <br>
              POST - /movies - Creates a new resource
              <br>
              PUT - /movies/{id} - Updates an existing resource by ID
              <br>
              DELETE - /movies/{id} - Deletes an existing resources by ID
              <br>
